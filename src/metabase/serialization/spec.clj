(ns metabase.serialization.spec
  "The serialization spec of a model, and applying it to a batch of entities in either direction.

  A spec is a map of:

  - `:schema`, the schema of an exported entity; dev and test check every export against it.
  - `:copy`, the columns exported and imported as they are.
  - `:skip`, the columns that are not serialized (`:id`, `:created_at` and `:updated_at` never are).
  - `:transform`, a map from a column to its transform, `{:export f :import g}`, where `f` and `g` are fns of a
    resolver, the batch of entities, and the column's values in that batch, returning the transformed values in the
    same order. A value of `::skip` leaves the key out. An `:as` key exports the column under another key. A transform
    with `:owned [model owner-key]` in place of `:import` exports the entities of `model` its owner owns, sorted by its
    `:order` key fn unless it has an `:export`, and a load of the owner loads them, matching them on their `:identity`
    and deleting the rows of the owner none matches.
  - `:defaults`, the non-nil values a column is left out of the export with.
  - `:identity`, the columns of a deserialized row that find the local row it updates, `[:entity_id]` by default."
